So I'm starting a log for our game engine (even though its been 8 months) because I think the people deserve
 to know how this was made. So uhh it may seem we literally copied this dudes zip from github and just ripped
  it right off but we actually did that because I must have accidentally deleted our project so I copied this
   one guy's who was on the same part we were on. We aren't copy and pasting, I really hate just getting a
    game engine from someone else. We just did that because we had no choice. Anyway this doesn't really
    matter because copied the stuff we already wrote. Plus the guy said anyone can use it. We also have to
    create all of the other stuff on our own.
